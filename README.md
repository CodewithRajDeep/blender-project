## Title: Blender project 

## Description: 
This contains the basic project made by me during learning blender tools.

## Field of Study: 
Blender is a free and open-source 3D computer graphics software tool set that runs on Windows, MacOS, BSD, Haiku, and Linux. It is used for creating animated films, visual effects, 
art, 3D-printed models, motion graphics, interactive 3D applications, virtual reality, and, formerly, video games. Blender's features include 3D modelling, UV mapping, texturing, digital drawing, 
raster graphics editing,rigging and skinning, fluid and smoke simulation, particle simulation, soft body simulation, sculpting, animation, match moving, rendering, motion graphics, video editing,
Python scripting, and compositing.

## Use of Blender:
Blender can be used to create anything from animated films to 3D-printed models, virtual reality, motion graphics, visual effects, interactive 3D applications, and even games.
